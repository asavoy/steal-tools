`steal-tools` is a collection of command-line utilities
that make building, packaging, and sharing ES6, CommonJS, AMD, and [Steal](https://github.com/bitovi/steal)
applications easy.

## Use

Currently, steal-tools depends 
on [steal]. Before doing a build, make
sure `steal.js` loads your app successfully in the browser.
