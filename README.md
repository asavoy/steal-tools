`steal-tools` is a collection of command-line utilities
that:
 
 - makes building ES6, CommonJS, AMD, and applications _easy_, and 
 - writes those builds so your apps load _fast_.

It is one half of the [StealJS](http://stealjs.com) project.  It's other half,
[steal](https://github.com/bitovi/steal) provides client-side dependency management.
